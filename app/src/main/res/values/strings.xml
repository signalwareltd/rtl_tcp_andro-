	    <h2>About this app</h2>
	    <p>This application is a port of rtl_tcp to the android platform. It allows other applications to start rtl_tcp and use the raw I/Q samples that it reads from
	    USB DVB-T dongles based on the RTL2832U chip</p>
	    <p>It also allows Android to stream over the network directly from the UI of the driver. This is an advanced feature and there could be bugs.</p>
