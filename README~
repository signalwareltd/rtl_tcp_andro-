rtl_tcp_andro
A modification of rtl_tcp and libusb-1.0 for running on Android (also works on other Linux based systems)

It is compatible with the original rtl_tcp with the following exceptions:

Added features:
 - Opening devices using a file descriptor (very important for Android)
 - An additional command for closing the app remotely and setting tuner gain in percentage

Possible bugs:
 - Once the client closes, rtl_tcp closes with it. This is a desired behaveour on Android but probably undesired if used for a client.

Note:
The rtl-sdr folder is completely unmodified. Therefore if a new version of rtl-sdr is released, just replace this folder with the newer version and recompile - everything should work out of the box.

Files modified in libusb-1.0 to create libusb-andro:
 core.c, libusb.h and libusbi.h - to header for and implementation of the open2 function wich takes an already open file descriptor
 linux_usbfs.c - to create a libusb handle from the fd

Compilation:
To compile for Android, use the Android.mk file in the jni directory
To compile for Linux invoke make. Binary will be created in the current directory

The modifications are released under GNU. See COPYING for details.
